Professional website made using GoFiber, HTMX, and TailwindCSS

Welcome to the Repository for my Personal Profolio Website

The Stack (This is a more minimalistic website stack)
HTMX - HTMX is a javascript library that you can import into your HTML files that will allow you to make http requests inline and allows you to slot in components to promote a reactive style. HTMX is also very fast as it's small in nature and the changes are done via sloting in the new HTML and refreshing the page.

Go - Go is used as the backend. We are specifically using GoFiber to create a server on the backend that allows us to host the html and css files on our local machine. GoFiber also supports the ability to let me do more functional changes to my site if I wanted to add that functionality.

Tailwind - Tailwind as a fast CSS framework that allows you to add style classes to your html in line and then automatically takes that class you mention and adds it directly to an output style sheet that you have to help speed up development. That way you're not adding the class then going to the css file to add the class and styling which will take time to do. 

What does that Website include?

This website includes a list of projects that I'm working on or have finished building. A direct link to my github profile and a contact me link that will slot in a contact form.
